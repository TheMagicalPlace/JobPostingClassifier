We have enjoyed a long and successful history developing and implementing technologies for complex gas separation, purification and liquefaction using a variety of techniques, including cryogenic distillation, partial condensation, adsorption, and membranes. The Process Gas Cryogenics group is an important team housing the technical and process expertise in the processing of complex feed gas streams. The scope includes helium extraction, recovery, purification, and liquefaction, hydrogen liquefaction, hydrogen and carbon dioxide separation, nitrogen rejection, NGL recovery, rare gas recovery and purification, and off gas and purge gas separation. The type of feed gas is highly variable, and the type of separation required depends on project economics and customer requirements.\n\nThe Senior Principal Process Engineer will need to work with the Business Development and Product Line organizations to develop novel, and often patentable, process cycles and technologies to either progress into a product offering or implement immediately in a project. This role requires the candidate to have innovative and out-of-the-box thinking in order to generate differentiating and valuable ideas. At the same time, the role also requires good organizational skills and discipline in driving development efforts toward completion using the rigorous stage-gate approach. Additionally, the role requires a sense of practicality to guide idea screening and technology development. The successful candidate needs to have strong chemical engineering fundamentals and excellent process simulation skills. The person also needs to be comfortable with ambiguity and complexity. Last but not least, we are looking for energetic people with a positive attitude and a strong initiative and a sense of project ownership.\n\nNATURE AND SCOPE\n\nThis is an individual contributor technologist role with a preferred focus on the application and process integration of membranes technology. The person need not have extensive previous experience in designing membrane-based process cycles, as long as they are technically strong and open to developing these skills. We are not looking for skills in membrane development, materials development, or membrane systems design. We are instead looking for process cycle development skills with a good understanding of when and how to use or integrate membrane systems in the flow sheet as an optimal solution. We will look to this technologist to provide leadership in membrane-based process technologies. The ideal candidate should have demonstrated experience in designing process cycles using process simulation tools utilizing an appropriate combination of dehydration, adsorption, compression, membranes, heat exchange, and cryogenic distillation unit operations. Prior experience in design, scale-up, start-up, and trouble-shooting field membrane installations, although not required, can be a desirable differentiating qualification. However, this must not be the candidate\u2019s main experience.\n\nPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTABILITIES\n\nThis position is accountable for the following end results:\n\n1) Deliver all objectively safely and achieve 100% compliance with safety requirements.\n\n2) Generate \u201cBlue Ocean\u201d ideas and concepts involving the use of various separations technologies including membranes in new markets or new applications with low competition and/or high profitability.\n\n3) Be able to evaluate ideas, processes and technologies based on applicability, CAPEX, OPEX, and return on investment.\n\n4) For ideas evaluated to be promising, build a business case, gather support, and take the concept rigorously through the stage gate process and drive it to conclusion, e.g., commercialization, or timely project termination if deemed unsuccessful (fail fast, fail cheap).\n\n5) File patent applications, if appropriate, to support our new technology development efforts. Maintain awareness of current competitive activities and the state of the development of new adsorption technologies by outside entities.\n\n6) Interface with the Business Development, Product Line, Project, and Operations organization to facilitate commercialization and start-up of new technology in the field. Work with Technology Manager to support technology testing needs of newly commercialized adsorption-based offerings.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS\nBS, MS, or PhD in Chemical Engineering.
