CHEMICAL ENGINEER

GeoControl Systems (GCS)

- Moffett Field, CA

As NASA prepares to send the humans to the moon and beyond, we need to develop novel technologies for life support systems. GeoControl Systems [ GCS ], is looking for a Chemical Engineer to join our Air Revitalization group at NASA’s Ames Research Center to conduct research to evaluate liquid sorbents for such applications. As a member of this team, you will utilize your background in chemistry and design of various wet chemistry experiments to determine gas/liquid mass transfer rates, reaction kinetics, and changes in physical properties. Specific experience synthesizing and/or studying liquid CO2 sorbents (including liquid amines and ionic liquids) is especially desired.

1 ) The Contractor shall provide technical support in the assembly and disassembly of laboratory hardware which can include lab glassware and support equipment, preparing and conducting of laboratory experiments, design of laboratory test systems, and planning of projects.

2 ) Designing and performing experiments include determination of gas/liquid mass transfer rates, reaction kinetics, and changes in physical properties.

3 ) The Contractor shall maintain laboratory equipment and apparatus in working order, and maintain a safe and organized laboratory area including clean-up of hazardous spills.

4 ) The Contractor shall perform compilation and evaluation of data acquired from testing and evaluation of laboratory hardware and air revitalization systems and prepare data for reports and presentations.

5 ) The Contractor shall prepare lists of items required to conduct laboratory experiments, and shall obtain product information, identify vendors and suppliers, assist in the preparation of material and supply acquisition, and order materials and equipment to maintain inventory.

6 ) The Contractor, on occasion, shall be required to work either extended hours or an adjusted shift to either early morning or late at night during periods of equipment and process testing.
